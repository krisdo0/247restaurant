<p><h1>247Restaurant</h1> A new website that can help users order food remotely. In the midst of the ongoing Covid pandemic, instead of customers having to go directly to restaurants to enjoy, 247Restaurant helps buyers order food at home. The website also helps restaurants to manage orders, manage a list of shippers and manage each shipper's shipping history, support epidemiological management and trace if there is a case related to Covid-19 . This website supports below types of users:</br></p>
<p>              Customer: They are registered users who are actual customers or potential customers.</br></p>
<p>              Shipper: They are the restaurantâ€™s delivery man.</br></p>
